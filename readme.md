# Gladiators

## Introduction

This program is intended to be a simple simulator for a battle arena where
'gladiators' (simple neural network controlled game artificial intelligences) 
compete, this arena is combined with genetic algorithms to improve the AI. This
is a toy project.

The idea is to get the program to a stage where it can evolve a gladiator that
can move around, hunt for food, kill enemy gladiators and doge projectiles.

Many of the parameter are configurable, so the food game mechanic can be
disabled for example, this changes the direction in which the gladiators can
evolve.
