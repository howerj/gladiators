# Gladiators

## Introduction

This program is intended to be a simple simulator for a battle arena where
'gladiators' (simple neural network controlled game artificial intelligences) 
compete, this arena is combined with genetic algorithms to improve the AI. This
is a toy project.

## To Do

### Plan

* Tweak Algorithm

### Misc

* Documentation/Tutorial
* Add human player gladiator
* Experiment with feeding in different information into the 'gladiators'
  - For example, state about themselves could be input
  - Feedback/Internal state for the neural network
* The genetic code for a gladiator could also specify its turn rate, speed,
health, etcetera. There would be a budget that for these that cannot be
exceeded. Alternatively different AIs could be generated for each gladiator
profile.
* Inertia needs to be added to the physics engine
* Minimap and window
